### Team story

Junior already has a SpendSmart account and needs to log in.

As a returning user, he is not greeted with the tutorial for new users. He then updated his monthly income with the latest information, and the dashboard visualization dynamically reflects this change. Junior then logs out of the account, returning them to the login page.

### James' Story

James, a student, wants to log his paycheck and check his past month's spending.

James is prompted with a series of questions prior to the signup process. James then chooses either an email password combination, or to login using google authentication. If successful, he is directed to the dashboard page, where he will then be faced with an AI generated tutorial of all the features. He can then add his income input and spending output and generate statistics about his monthly spending. 

### Jia Yi's Story

Clair wants to check how much she’s spent that month. 

She logs into SpendSmart and looks at her spending on the dashboard. She decides that she’s been spending too much on eating out so she asks the AI assistant to create a budgeting plan that lowers her expenses on food. 

### Anthony's Story

When Anthony signs up for the app for the very first time, he is prompted with a series of questions. Based on his answers to the questions, the app provides him with relevant suggestions to make smart financial decisions. 

### Ysajelle’s story

Ysajelle just signed up for Netflix membership, she opened SpendSmart, created a new category labeled “recreation expense”, added the cost of Netflix membership fee under that category. Then, whenever she spends anything on recreation, she adds it to the “recreation expense” category. When she checked her account after a few months, she found that she spent a lot on recreation in December 2024 by looking at December’s summary of expenses by categories. 

### Annie's Story

Annie has two jobs that she would like to track in SpendSmart. 

One of the jobs is a full-time job; the other one is a part-time contract job. She would like to separate the incomes from the two sources to verify that both of them are worth her time. Annie logs in to the SmartSpend account and sets one income type as a full-time (fixed) income with the source marked as her first job. The fixed income has a paycheck twice a month with a fixed amount, which does not need to be updated later on. The other payouts are categorized as part-time (variable) income, where the amount paid each time depends on the month and needs to be inputted every time.
